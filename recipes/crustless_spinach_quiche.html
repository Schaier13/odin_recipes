        <h2>Crustless Quiche Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

         <li><b>Eggs</b>
            <p>Because this quiche doesn't have a crust, you'll need five eggs to hold the mixture together.</p></li>

         <li><b>Spinach</b>
            <p>Frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) works best, but you can use fresh spinach if that's all you have on hand.</p></li>

         <li><b>Onion</b>
            <p>A yellow or white onion adds a depth of flavor to the quiche.</p></li>

            <p>Muenster is a mild cheese that melts well and will add a delicious flavor cheesy to the quiche.</p></li>

        <li><b>Spices</b>
            <p>Simple salt and pepper is all you need.</p></li>

        </ul>
